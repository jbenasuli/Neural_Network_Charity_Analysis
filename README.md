# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to build a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a charity will effectively use the money raised if funded. By leveraging machine learning and neural networks a deep learning model is generated to evaluate potential success. After generating the initial neural network model and measuring its efficacy, various adjustments to its structure are implemented in order to optimize performance.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions

There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation
